# text-processor-intermediate

Frontend Development:

Create a user interface (UI) where users can upload text files. You can use HTML for the structure and CSS for styling.
Implement a file input element to allow users to select text files from their local filesystem.
Use JavaScript to handle file upload events and read the contents of the uploaded text files.
Backend Development (Optional):

Depending on your requirements, you may need a backend server to handle file uploads and processing. You can use Node.js with Express.js for building a simple backend API.
Implement endpoints to receive uploaded text files from the frontend and process them.
Word Frequency Analysis:

Write JavaScript code to analyze the frequency of words in the uploaded text files.
Break down the text files into individual words and count the occurrences of each word.
You can use JavaScript functions to split the text into words, remove punctuation, and convert words to lowercase for consistency.
Display Results:

Present the results of the word frequency analysis to the user. This could be in the form of a table, chart, or list showing the most common words and their frequencies.
Use HTML and CSS to structure and style the results section of your UI.
Update the UI dynamically with the analysis results using JavaScript.
Optional Enhancements:

Allow users to customize the analysis by filtering out common words (stop words) or specifying additional criteria.
Implement features such as sorting the results by frequency or searching for specific words.
Add error handling to handle cases where file uploads fail or the analysis encounters issues.
Testing and Deployment:

Test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected, including handling different file formats and sizes.
Deploy your application to a hosting platform or server so that it can be accessed by users.
Overall, building a JavaScript project for analyzing the frequency of words in text files can be a rewarding learning experience and a practical tool for text analysis tasks.
